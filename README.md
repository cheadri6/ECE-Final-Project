## Running the Program
 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
 2. Make sure you have all imports installed on your local computer.
 3. Change file parameters within the code to match your local directory's audio files that you wish to modulate.
 4. Each cell in the Jupyter Notebook does different things. In the comments at the top of the cell it explains what each cell does. Simply decide which task you need to accomplish and then run that code having changed the audio file parameters to your audio files.
